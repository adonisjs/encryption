## Introduction
AdonisJS encryption packages is used to encrypt, sign and base64 encode values. The encryption is performed using `aes-256-cbc` algorithm. A unique `iv` is generated for each encryption call and therefore two encrypted output for the same value are different.

## Official Documentation
The documentation is available on the [AdonisJS website](https://docs.adonisjs.com/guides/security/encryption)
